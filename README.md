Hi I am Ben Mbouombouo, co-founder of a starups in Silicon Valley.
Already applying AI/ML in our embedded systems for health monitoring using available CPUs and other peripherals
Also developing NPU chips for consumer and wearable devices and applications for AI/ML on the edges for all various AI/ML architectures:
| Architecture      | Typical Use                | Edge Platform/Framework              | Notes/Performance          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| 1D-CNN/TinyML CNN | Biosignal classification   | TF Lite Micro, Edge Impulse          | Best for PPG, ECG, HRV     |
| LSTM/GRU          | Time-series/sequence       | TF Lite Micro, PyTorch Mobile        | Fall, arrhythmia, activity |
| RF/DT/SVM         | Fast, low-power decisions  | scikit-learn, SensiML, TF Lite Micro | Hydration, anomaly         |
| Hybrid CNN-LSTM   | Multimodal fusion          | TF Lite Micro, custom hardware       | Multi-sensor wearable      |
| Tiny Transformer  | Trend analysis, adaptation | TF Lite Micro, HW accelerator        | Growing, sleep/EEG/MSD     |
| Neuromorphic      | Always-on, ultra-low-power | Ambiq, BrainChip, hardware           | Emerging, ppmW IoT/sensors |
